## Introduction

Welcome to my Blackjack game! This project showcases my skills in web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The motivation behind this project was to practice and enhance my abilities while creating a fun and interactive game that mimics the classic casino experience.

## Project Overview

This web-based Blackjack game is designed to provide an engaging and user-friendly experience. It includes the following features:

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play the classic game of Blackjack directly in your browser.
- **Natural Blackjack Payout**: Win 2.5x your bet when you get a natural Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card as your initial two cards).
- **Splitting Hands**: Split your hand when you have two cards of the same value.
- **Doubling Down**: Double your bet and receive exactly one more card.
- **Add Funds**: Easily replenish your balance during the game.
- **Responsive Design**: The game scales properly across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Personal Touches**: Features "Luke Zhuang's Casino" as the title and includes links to my social media profiles.
